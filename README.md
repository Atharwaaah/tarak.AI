# 🌊 tarak.AI - Real-time River Pollution Reporting and Analysis

**"Tarak" (तारक)** in Sanskrit means *Savior* or *Protector*, and **AI** represents the Artificial Intelligence core of this project. **tarak.AI2** is an interactive web application designed to tackle the problem of unreported river pollution by empowering the public to participate in environmental monitoring.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

**tarak.AI2** allows users to report river pollution in real time, primarily by uploading images. These images are processed by the **InstructBLIP Vision-Language Model**, which helps in:

- Determining the severity of pollution
- Identifying and classifying visible pollutants

Additional features include( To be Integrated in future):

- Manual or automated (via EXIF data) location tagging
- Generation of pollution reports for public research
- Local and searchable air/water pollution statistics (Google Maps API integration)
- Government initiatives displayed in a dynamic slideshow format
- **Multi-language support** (via Bhashini integration) for inclusivity across Indian communities

---

## ⚠️ Current Challenges

- **Deployment:** Handling model dependencies and real-time performance
- **Image Processing Workflow:** InstructBLIP is computationally intensive  
- **Model Integration:**  
  - Beginner approach: Use pre-trained InstructBLIP  
  - Learning goal: Fine-tune the model using datasets like **TACO**, with guidance from the SLCR team

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Creation of a mobile app with all core features and a social media-like interface
- Integration of government APIs for real-time data and program insights
- Fine Tuning the model
- Gamification
